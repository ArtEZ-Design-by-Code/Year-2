Semester 1

## Assignment

This project is intended to give you an introduction to all aspects of the field of contemporary web design and development. We will discuss programming languages on the web, using JavaScript at the core, setting up a Node server, real-time communication using WebSockets, modern layouts and typograpy using webfonts and CSS grids, and visuals on the web using WebGL and SVG.

Each week, you will take the topics we have discussed in class, continue learning about them and compiling your findings into a single, small web experiment. By the end of the assignment, you will have a collection of experiments that you can present altogether as an introduction to modern web techniques.

## Goals

- Learning the basic workings of web communications and websites
- Learning to program for the web on the backend as well as the frontend using modern techniques
- Designing for the web as opposed to other forms of digital design
- Understanding databases and content management

## Roadmap

For six weeks, we will discuss different techniques in class. Each week, you will present a website. By the end, you will present your compendium of web experiments.

## Criteria

- How well do you translate the concepts we discuss in class into practical examples?
- Are you able to come up with your own aesthetics on the web?
- Do you understand the potential for web technologies in the context of new forms of narration and communication?
- Do your experiments work technically?
