Semester 2

## Assignment

“Simulation” has proven to be a fertile theme for contemporary media. From films like The Matrix that discuss the implications of reality as a simulation to simulated realities in videogames like Red Dead Redemption and art pieces like Damien Hirst’s Treasures From the Wreck of the Unbelievable, simulations allow us to tell stories, transport us to alternate universes, and magnify parts of reality.

The theme for this assignment is definitively broad. The starting point for your work will be narrowing down this theme into a topic that you find interesting and relevant. You will then choose a piece of reality to focus on, that you will then simulate using code. This can be a simulation of a natural process depicted as a film, but it can also become a Twitter bot that simulates a conversation. The medium for your end result is also free, as long as you get there by using code.

As always, as a group you will be responsible for your end presentation. Discuss what each of you needs for their exhibition and divide up tasks for you to produce the final presentation.

## Goals

-	Observing reality
-	Simulating recorded reality using code
-	Improving technical abilities
-	Self-learning coding and analysing coding problems

## Roadmap

-	Week 1: The assignment in one week: prototype a simulation.
-	Week 2: Narrow down the theme of transformations to a topic you will research. Begin your visual research, start recording and gathering. Sketches.
-	Week 3: Continued recording. Sketches.
-	Week 4: Continued recording. Sketches. Direction for outcome.
-	Week 5:  Sketches, development, programming, execution.
-	Week 6:  Sketches, development, programming, execution. Outcome nearly complete, discuss and implement refinements and improvements.
-	Week 7: Final presentation

## Criteria

-	How well did you manage to narrow down a broad theme to an individual topic?
-	How well do your sketches fit your topic?
-	Technical abilities – were you able to translate your ideas into code that produces interesting results?
-	Originality and ideation – is the end result enticing and original?
